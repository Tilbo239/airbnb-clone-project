## üìà Database Design

### Entities and Relationships

#### 1. **Users**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `username`: Unique name
- `email`: Contact email
- `password`: Hashed password
- `role`: User or Host

#### 2. **Properties**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: References User
- `title`: Property title
- `location`: Address
- `price`: Price per night

**Relation:** A user can own multiple properties.

#### 3. **Bookings**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: References User
- `property_id`: References Property
- `check_in`: Start date
- `check_out`: End date

**Relation:** A booking is made by a user for a property.

#### 4. **Payments**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: References Booking
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `status`: Success/Failure
- `timestamp`: Date of transaction

**Relation:** Each booking has one payment.

#### 5. **Reviews**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: References User

- `rating`: Score
- `comment`: Text review

**Relation:** Users can leave multiple reviews, one per property per booking.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Provides user registration, login, and profile editing. Ensures only authenticated users can access protected resources.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create and manage property listings. Supports CRUD operations with data validation.

### Booking System
Allows users to book properties for specific dates. Handles check-in/check-out tracking and conflicts.

### Payment Processing
Securely processes payments linked to bookings. Tracks payment status and provides receipts.

### Review System
Users can leave feedback and ratings on properties after completing a booking.

### API Documentation
REST and GraphQL endpoints are documented with OpenAPI and introspection for easy integration.

### Performance Optimization
Uses database indexing and Redis-based caching to enhance performance and reduce load.

## üîê API Security

- **Authentication:** Uses token-based authentication to verify user identity.
- **Authorization:** Role-based permissions ensure users can only access allowed resources.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects APIs from abuse by limiting request frequency.
- **Data Validation:** Prevents injection and malicious input.
- **Secure Payments:** Encrypts sensitive payment information and uses trusted payment gateways.

**Importance:**
- Protects personal and financial data
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Ensures trust in the platform
